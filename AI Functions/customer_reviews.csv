review
Super clean airport. Got through security pretty fast and everyone was polite. Nice change from other airports I've been to.
"Honestly, it was quick and painless. Arrived, checked in, and was at my gate in under 30 minutes."
Loved the design—tons of windows and natural light. The Indigenous art everywhere is a really nice touch.
Customs was smooth. CBSA officers were polite and kept things moving.
Check-in was super easy. The kiosks worked fine and there were people around to help if needed.
"My flight was delayed, but the staff at the gate were great about giving updates. Didn’t feel totally left in the dark."
Friendly staff and a cool little souvenir shop near Gate D. Found some last-minute gifts that weren’t overpriced.
"Even during a busy afternoon, the bathrooms were spotless. Appreciate the cleaning staff keeping up with it."
Not a lot of food options late at night. Pretty much everything closed by 9:30.
Had a 5-hour layover and was happy to find a quiet corner with decent Wi-Fi and outlets. Made a long wait bearable.
"Parking was fine but honestly, just take the Canada Line. Way cheaper and drops you off right at the terminal."
"Solid experience overall. Nothing amazing, but no major complaints either."
Flight info screens were accurate and easy to read. Helpful when you’re trying to make a tight connection.
"Wi-Fi is free, but it dropped a couple times while I was streaming. Not terrible, but could be better."
They had live music in the terminal when I was there—unexpected and kind of awesome.
Got through security in under 10 minutes. Love when that happens.
Veggie options were lacking. Ended up with a muffin and coffee—not ideal before a long flight.
Bags came out quickly and in one piece. That’s all I really care about.
YVR is clean and well-run. Feels a bit older in some spots but everything worked fine.
Signage could be better around the international departures area. Got a bit turned around.
"From check-in to boarding, the whole process was smooth. Staff were helpful at every step."
Everything is close by. I didn’t have to walk miles to find my gate like in some airports.
Pouring rain outside but warm and calm inside. Vancouver vibes all the way.
"Waited about 15 minutes for a cab, but at least the pickup zone was organized."
The Starbucks line was ridiculous. Could really use another coffee option in the domestic terminal.
Probably the nicest airport in Canada I’ve flown through. Easy to navigate and not stressful.
Boarding announcements were clear and done in multiple languages. Appreciated that.
Free luggage carts! More airports should do this.
Traveling with kids was actually easy. The play areas helped a lot.
"Some areas feel a bit dated, especially near domestic baggage claim. Could use a facelift."
"CBSA officer was actually friendly. That’s rare in my experience, so kudos."
Landed late and there were still staff around to answer questions and help people find transportation.
Duty-free store had a great BC wine selection. Grabbed a bottle of ice wine for family.
"It’s not the most exciting airport, but it’s clean and calm. Easy to chill or nap if you’ve got time."
"No issues. Checked in, cleared security, boarded. What more do you want?"
I was through check-in and customs in about 35 minutes. Super efficient.
Lots of natural light and wood accents. Doesn’t even feel like a typical airport.
I lost my phone and the staff actually helped me track it down. Huge thanks to lost and found!
"Bathrooms were clean, there were no crazy lines, and I didn’t get lost. That’s a win."
Needs more charging stations near the gates. Had to sit on the floor to plug in my laptop.
"It was a bit packed in the arrivals hall, but bags came out fast."
"Boarding was a little disorganized for our flight, but we still left on time."
Had never flown into Vancouver before and was impressed. Staff were friendly and the airport felt welcoming.
Really like the local art and water features. Makes the place feel calm and different from other airports.
Seats were limited near my gate and a bunch of them didn’t have power outlets.
Traveled with my elderly parents and the wheelchair assistance was excellent. Staff were so patient and kind.
"Long-ish walk from my gate to baggage claim, but the moving sidewalks helped."
Everything went smoothly. Honestly one of the least stressful airport experiences I’ve had.
"Took a while for the bags to show up, but at least the screens kept giving updates."
Would definitely use YVR again. Way better than Pearson or Calgary in my opinion.
